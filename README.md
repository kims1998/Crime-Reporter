## Description:

Crime Reporter is an application that allows students and faculty to see crime reports that occurred within San Diego State University Global Campus. The students and faculty will be able to get further information on the incident to keep them aware of the crimes that occur around the campus. The users will also be able to submit a local crime report as a placeholder, since official reports won't be immediate.

------
## Usage:

To use this application, node.js and Vite will be needed. After those are installed, the necessary dependencies will need to be installed. Run the following commands:

```aiignore
npm i
```

To run development, use:
```aiignore
npm run dev
```
